<p1>1.  <b>    The moonlight is in full bloom 
Casting shadows far and wide 
Yet under the moonlight we lay
The blossoms fill the air with whispered songs of hope 
I softly chase the shadows that may haunt your day 
Then when the night is calling I'm here to show you the way
Just like the moonlight does, I'll be yours.
You're the most beautiful thing i have ever set my eyes on 
Everytime i gasp in thy presence for your beauty flabbergasts me.
The gods were surely smiling upon me the day you became mine 
I want to caress your skin like a down father 
And drown in the beautiful softness of you
So dance with me tonight mi amor and throw your cares and worries away
I'll hold you close and keep you safe, till the coming of the day
    Let's dance the night away until the last shadows of the moonlight fade into the dawn's  light. </b>

    <p> 2.<b> For so long I've yearned of this 
Craved and dreamt of this day 
The day that you'll see me as i see you 
I never really knew you 
You are just another friend 
But when i got to know you
I let my heart unbend 
I let my heart feel

I can't help past memories
That would only make me cry 
Broken hearts & failed relationships
Agony & pain
Endless tears 
Ruptured dreams of the future 
I've decided to forget all that
Rub in in a box and throw it away 
Giving love another try 
I hope pray wish that this time it gonna be different 
Its gonna last 

And now that i have found you 
Amidst all those texts 
I've seen the queen you're 
An angel walking among men 
A rare gem I've found and want to treasure
You're just perfect 
Just the way you're
My dream girl 

You are the star that lights up my dark night
The sun that brightens up my life 
Bringing warmth 
You're the reason behind my smile

Your beautiful within and without
Your beady brown sexy eyes 
Glowing shining like the sunrise
I can't help but stare 
From your beauty I can't efface 
Talking to you makes me happy 
Gladdens my heart 
Makes my days,life worthwhile 
They say men arw just men
But u wanna life my life proving to you that not all men are sane 
Not all the same
Loving you
Caring for you 
Even amidst life storms i'll hold you together
Make u happy when you sad
Till the end comes unto us

I just hope you'll see me 
I hope you'll notice me
For this feeling is strong 
I can't hide it
I can't control it 
I just have one dream 
Just one wish this Christmas
Can you make it true,a reality? 
Can you be mine?
Will you be my Juliet? </b>
    </p>

<br>
    <br>
    <p1>3. <b> You came to my life 
And changed it in a twitch of the eye 
your acts of love care and touch got me moved and hooked 
Just like a addict you're my drug
You gave light to my life and soul
You made me complete and whole 
You've blown the dark gloom roof up on my life and let me see the blue sky and soar high 
You own my heart you've became its master & I can never escape 
Being captive to you is all I want 
Its greater and precious than freedom
Your beauty is out of this world 
You mirror far more loveliness and grace
Than anyone I have ever cared for
From my mind your beauty I can't efface 
Your sweet smiles 
Contagious laughter
My eyes adore
Your voice has the cooling effect on a hot starless night
You're flexible well rounded and endowed at the appropriate quarters  
A hour Glass figure
Your luscious lips 
I dream them on mine 
Your soft delicate fingers on my body I yearn 
Your sexy thighs leaves me in Daze 
Tempted to touch
It's all worth it its all grand 
If I'm going to walk the road of life 
Let me walk with you hand in hand
Till the end of time 
You bring so much joy happiness and pleasure and that I'm grateful for and everything else 
Your precious to me I treasure you
You're a million in one
You're all I need
All I desire
All I want 
        Now tomorrow and for ever </b>
I love you.</p1>

    <p> <b> 4. I hope you find someone who will slowly lessen your loneliness until completely goes away. Someone who will not run away after seeing the rifts in your heart, but instead will go out of the way to stand by you.
I hope you find someone who will care about the troubles that are living inside your head. Someone who will understand why you overthink. Someone who will honestly tell you everything that on his mind, so you will not have to worry and doubt yourself.
I hope you find someone better than the last person you loved.
I hope that when you will be ready to enter in a relationship again, you will carefully choose someone whom you will be certain about spending your future with. I hope you will not settle for less. I hope you will not commit to someone who doesn’t realize the value your heart holds.
I hope you find the right one.
I hope you find someone who will be able to handle your enthusiasm about life, your loud and energetic vibes, your total independence, and your passion in pursuit of your dreams. I hope you find the person who will help you grow and flourish. I hope you find someone who will bring out the best in you.
I hope you find someone who will make dating simple. Someone who will want more than just casual. Someone who will not be afraid to show you, and tell you their feelings. Someone who will not be interested in playing by the rules of a dating game. Someone who will not keep a tally of who text first and last.
I hope you’re still the kind of person who believes in happy endings. I hope you don’t give up in search for your compatible lover, no matter how uncertain you are about when that person will take a major role in your life. I hope you keep the light in your soul, because that person you’re waiting for so long will eventually come.
        And I hope you don’t lose faith. </b>

    <p5> <b>5. The love you deserve will choose you just as confidently as you choose it. The love you deserve will fight for what you have when difficulty hangs heavy in the air, it will insist that you are stronger together, that you are capable of beating the odds, that you are filled with the potential to turn your losses into lessons — into seeds that will make it stronger. The love you deserve will be your voice of reason, it will build your restless heart a safe place within itself. The love you deserve will love you unapologetically, and that beauty, that softness, will inspire you to believe in the human being you are becoming. The love you deserve will see gardens within you where you see cemeteries. The love you deserve will support you, it will ruthlessly believe in your mind, it will celebrate your depth of feeling. The love you deserve will be proud of you not just when you are a shining example of yourself, but also when you are not. The love you deserve will love you, even when you do not deserve it. The love you deserve will clap for the parts of yourself you always used to hide, it will cherish the twists within your soul that others always wanted to untie. The love you deserve will peek into the most profound parts of who you are, and it will cradle you there. It will not cower, it will not run away. The love you deserve will be your best when you are not your best. It will show up for you in the dark. But most importantly, the love you deserve will teach you how to trust in the timing of your life. How to trust in the fact that it was always going to find you. The love you deserve will teach you how courageous it is to simply have faith in the heart of another, how difficult and messy and beautiful vulnerability can be after years of hurt. The love you deserve will teach you that you were never too much for those you always tried to give your soul to. You were always enough. You were just giving your heart to the wrong people. You were always worthy. Please don’t ever forget that.</b>
