<p> 1. Eyes are captivating beautiful, not because of the color but because of the words they hold within them.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    2.You're an adventure I want to take. You're walking on a tightrope when I'm afraid of heights. You're the smell after it rains, and the depth of the ocean when I am afraid of its vastness‚Äîbut everything else, you are the one thing that makes sense.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. When the moon rises and the sunsets, my heart sighs and yearns to see your glimpse every single night... But you don't arrive... And yet with our memories, I survive and come back with a hope to see you the every next night...üåôüí´‚ú®

        <li>Wake up with a smile so that I can be sure that today is going to be a bright and beautiful day for me. I have been missing you all night long. Good morning</li><br>
        <li>When I think of you I smile, and when I smile I think of you. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the thinking that makes me smile or the smile that keeps me thinking. All I know is I‚Äôm always thinking of you and smiling.</li><br>

        <li>You deserve flowers on your doorstep and coffee in the morning. You deserve notes left on your dashboard and ice-cream subdaes at 3am. You deserve honesty everyday and to be kissed every hour. You deserve to be remained how beautiful you are....</li><br>
        <li>It's you. You mean everything to me. You're the first thought in my head in the morning when I wake up and my last thought before I go to bed. You smile at me in my dreams. When you're sad, I feel sad and when I see your smile, I feel incredible like there's no other thing arround and all. I can see it you.</li> <br>
        <li>I'm not just falling in love with you. I'm falling in to you. you're an ocean, and I'm falling in, drowning in the depths of who you are, like you said, it's a scary in a way, but it's also more amazing thing I've ever experienced. You're the most amazing thing I've ever experienced. ‚ù§Ô∏è</li> <br>

    <p class="poi">‚ÄúI hope you find someone who will slowly lessen your loneliness until completely goes away. Someone who will not run away after seeing the rifts in your heart, but instead will go out of the way to stand by you.
I hope you find someone who will care about the troubles that are living inside your head. Someone who will understand why you overthink. Someone who will honestly tell you everything that on his mind, so you will not have to worry and doubt yourself.
I hope you find someone better than the last person you loved.
I hope that when you will be ready to enter in a relationship again, you will carefully choose someone whom you will be certain about spending your future with. I hope you will not settle for less. I hope you will not commit to someone who doesn‚Äôt realize the value your heart holds.
I hope you find the right one.
I hope you find someone who will be able to handle your enthusiasm about life, your loud and energetic vibes, your total independence, and your passion in pursuit of your dreams. I hope you find the person who will help you grow and flourish. I hope you find someone who will bring out the best in you.
I hope you find someone who will make dating simple. Someone who will want more than just casual. Someone who will not be afraid to show you, and tell you their feelings. Someone who will not be interested in playing by the rules of a dating game. Someone who will not keep a tally of who text first and last.
I hope you‚Äôre still the kind of person who believes in happy endings. I hope you don‚Äôt give up in search for your compatible lover, no matter how uncertain you are about when that person will take a major role in your life. I hope you keep the light in your soul, because that person you‚Äôre waiting for so long will eventually come.
And I hope you don‚Äôt lose faith.‚Äù</p> <br>
